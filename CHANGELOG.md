# Recent updates
## [1.1.0] - 2023/03/11
Ecma has added many features since the last update, so I essentially recreated the package to fit 2020s standards.
- Optimized, refactored, and organized the codebase
- No breaking changes, all exports have had their names and return types preserved
- Added Prettier and EditorConfig, switch from npm to pnpm
- I have not managed to fix that issue about multi-component emojis, unfortunately
